# prework-study-guide
## Description

I made this project as an assignment to create a study guide to learn some of the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. 

I learned a lot of the basics making this site, so I would recommend remaking the site, if you are a beginner seeking to learn the basics.
